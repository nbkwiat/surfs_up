## Overview of Analysis

I have been performing an analysis of weather changes for W. Avy the owner of a surf and ice cream business. He is interested in seeing the weather statistics for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

Using sqlalchemy and flask I have so far been able to run queries connected to sqlite databases and using python to display data accurately.

## Results

  - The average temperature in June is 74 compared to 71 degrees. This isnt too big of a difference to affect customer sales.
  - The minimum temperature was 51 degrees in december which I think would be too cold for ice cream and surfing however, this could just be due to a rainy day.
  - Roughly half of the time the temperatures for both months hover in the low 70s. This is adequate surfing weather and in my opinion still a reasonable temperature to be eating ice cream.
  
  
  
## Summary

Overall I believe that surfing and ice cream year round is a perfectly acceptable business idea. There are a couple things that could be looked at further such as tropical storm watching. This could be looked at to see what time of year is the most popular for tropical storms to arise. This could negatively affect business. Another thing that could be looked at is the amount of tourists that come per year and the most frequent time of travel. W. Avy has a pretty solid business plan and I believe he will be successful in his business endeavors.
